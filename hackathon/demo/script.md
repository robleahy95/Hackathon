# Demo Script (60 seconds)

## The Script

> "OpenClaw showed us AI can actually do things. But it runs locally, needs setup. What if agentic AI was just a URL?
>
> [Show app] I built this in 2 hours with v0. Powered by Fin.
>
> Watch: 'Log Sarah from Intercom as a hot lead.'
>
> [Assistant confirms, triggers webhook]
>
> Done. She's in my Notion.
>
> 'Send follow-up to John about our call.'
>
> [Assistant drafts, confirms, sends]
>
> Sent. No copy-paste, no switching apps.
>
> This is what Fin can be — not just answering questions, but doing the work. Web-native, no install, built with v0.
>
> BD chaos → automated."

## Timing Breakdown

| Section | Time | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| Hook | 10s | OpenClaw reference, problem statement |
| Show app | 5s | Display the interface |
| Demo 1 | 15s | Log a lead, show confirmation, show Notion |
| Demo 2 | 15s | Send follow-up, show draft, confirm |
| Close | 15s | Value prop, call to action |

## Key Moments to Nail

1. **The hook** — Reference OpenClaw (everyone knows it), position yours as the web-native version
2. **The first action** — Make sure "Log Sarah" works flawlessly
3. **The Notion proof** — Have Notion open in another tab, show the entry appeared
4. **The close** — "BD chaos → automated" is your soundbite

## Backup Phrases

If something breaks:

- "In production, this would create the Notion entry — let me show you the payload"
- "The webhook is live, sometimes there's a few seconds delay"
- "Here's what the experience looks like when it's working" [show mocked version]

## Practice Checklist

- [ ] Read through once silently
- [ ] Read through once out loud
- [ ] Time yourself (should be 55-65 seconds)
- [ ] Practice the transitions between actions
- [ ] Know where your Notion tab is for the proof moment
