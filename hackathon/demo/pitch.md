# Pitch Positioning

## One-Liner

> "A web-based BD assistant that doesn't just chat — it logs leads, sends follow-ups, and updates your pipeline. Built with v0, powered by Fin."

---

## Why You Built It

> "I've sourced 30+ meetings at conferences. The follow-up chaos is real — lost contacts, forgotten context, manual everything. I wanted an assistant that actually DOES the work."

---

## Why It Matters

> "OpenClaw proved agentic AI works. But it's local, needs setup. This is the web-native version — accessible immediately, no install, powered by Fin."

---

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "You know that feeling after a conference — 20 business cards, scribbled notes, and you're supposed to follow up with everyone? I've sourced 30+ qualified meetings at events. The chaos is real.
>
> So I built a BD assistant that actually does things. Not just chat — it logs leads to Notion, sends follow-up emails, updates my pipeline. All through conversation.
>
> Built this morning with v0, powered by Fin. Web-native, no install. BD chaos, automated."

## Q&A Prep

**"How does it actually work?"**
> "You chat with the assistant, it parses your intent, shows a confirmation of the action, and triggers a webhook to Notion/email. The AI understands context — 'Log Sarah from Intercom as hot' becomes a structured lead entry."

**"Why Fin instead of just ChatGPT?"**
> "Fin is designed for business workflows, not general chat. It's built to take actions, not just answer questions. Plus it integrates directly with Intercom's ecosystem."

**"What's the business model?"**
> "This is a prototype, but the model would be SaaS for BD teams — per-seat pricing, connects to your existing CRM, automates the manual work between meetings and CRM updates."

**"How is this different from a CRM?"**
> "CRMs are databases. This is the interface layer. You don't open Salesforce and fill forms — you tell the assistant what happened and it handles the data entry. Natural language in, structured data out."

**"Did you actually use this today?"**
> "I'm going to use it right now — let me log you as a contact." [If appropriate, demo live with them]

## Networking Hooks

Use these to start conversations:

- "I'm building a tool to solve my own problem — conference follow-up chaos. What's your biggest BD pain point?"
- "Have you seen OpenClaw? I'm building the web-native version for BD."
- "I'm curious how [their company] handles lead capture at events."
- "What brings you to the hackathon? I'm exploring how Fin can do more than support."
