## v0 Prompts (Copy These)

### Prompt 1: Chat Interface
```
Build a chat interface for a "BD Assistant" that takes actions. Include: a clean header with "BD Assistant" and tagline "I don't just chat. I do things.", example prompts as clickable chips ("Log a new contact", "Send a follow-up", "Add to pipeline"), chat message area, input field at bottom. Use dark mode, minimal design, professional SaaS styling.
```

### Prompt 2: Action Cards
```
Add action confirmation cards: when assistant takes an action, show a card with action type header, parsed details (Name, Company, Priority with colored badge), "✓ Confirm" and "Edit" buttons. After confirm, show success with green checkmark and "View in Notion →" link.
```

### Prompt 3: Widget Style
```
Add "Powered by Fin" footer, Intercom-style gradient on header (purple to blue), more rounded message bubbles. Make it feel like an Intercom product.

3. **Demo 1 (15s):** "Log Sarah from Intercom as hot lead" → confirm → show Notion
4. **Demo 2 (15s):** "Send follow-up to John" → draft → confirm
5. **Close (15s):** "Fin doing work, not just answering. BD chaos → automated."
